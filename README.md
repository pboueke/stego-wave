# stego-wave

Simple tool for .wav LSB steganography.

### Setup

If you don't have common-lisp installed and is using linux, follow these steps for a quick setup:

* install ```sbcl```
* install [quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
* clone this repository at ```~/.quicklisp/local-projects```

In theory, you should be ready to go. For additional ease of use, install [maid](https://github.com/egoist/maid) and use the ```maidfile.md``` to run development tasks.
