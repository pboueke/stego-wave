# stego-wave

Simple tool for .wav steganography.

### Setup

You should have ```Quicklisp``` installed. The project was created using ```quickload```, and should be located somewhere where ```ASDF``` is able to find it, such as the default project directory used by ```Quicklisp``` (~/quicklisp/local-projects/). Then, load it as you would do any other project using ```(ql:quickload "stego-wave")```.
